# Moon Rover System Modeling Project

## Overview

This project is part of the ECEN 3301 Biomedical Signals and Systems course, aimed at understanding and simulating linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Specifically, this project involves modeling the dynamics of a rover sent to the moon to collect rock samples. Students will derive theoretical equations of motion, implement numerical simulations in Simulink, and design optimized control inputs to fulfill specific mission goals.


## Project Goals

- Model physical systems mathematically using differential equations and Laplace transforms.
- Implement and verify simulations of system responses in MATLAB Simulink.
- Design and optimize system inputs to achieve specific mission criteria (distance, payload).
